# hillmaker



**hillmaker** is a Python package that computes time of day and day of week specific
occupancy statistics from transaction data containing arrival and departure
timestamps. Typical use is for capacity planning problems in places like
hospital emergency departments, surgical recovery rooms or any system in which
entities arrive, occupy capacity for some amount of time, and then depart. It
gets its name from the hill-like nature of plots based on temporal occupancy
statistics.

- usable via a CLI, a function based API and and objected oriented API
- takes a pandas DataFrame or csv file as the input data type
- computes arrival, departure and occupancy summary statistics
  by time of day, day of week, and entity category based on a dataframe containing one
  record per visit.
- computes arrival, departure and occupancy for each datetime bin in a specified date range
- select any time bin size (minutes) that divides evenly into a day.
- output statistics includes sample size, mean, min, max, standard deviation,
  coefficient of variation, standard error, skew, kurtosis, and percentiles.
- weekly and day of week plots can be created by default or on demand; numerous plot related input parameters are available,
- summary report for length of stay automatically created
- outputs are stored in a dictionary containing pandas dataframes and as matplotlib figures. These can be accessed by methods for further post-processing or for exporting to external files.
- Requires Python >= 3.10, pandas >= 1.5.0, numpy >= 1.22, pydantic >= 2.1.1, seaborn >= 0.12.2, matplotlib >= 3.7.1, and tomli >= 2.0.1 (if not using Python 3.11)

Installation
-------------

You can install using pip:

    pip install hillmaker
    
You should also be able to install hillmaker from conda-forge shortly (?) into a virtual environment.

    conda config --add channels conda-forge
    conda config --set channel_priority strict
    conda install hillmaker 
    
If you want to get the latest update which is not yet on PyPI or conda-forge, you can install from the GitHub repo's `develop` branch:

    pip install git+https://github.com/misken/hillmaker@develop

Quick Start
-----------

See the [Getting Started](https://hillmaker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html) page in the hillmaker docs.

How to contribute
-----------------

Use the GitHub issue tracking system to report problems with the software, seek support, or suggest improvements. 
Code contributions can be suggested using GitHub pull requests. 

The `develop` branch contains the latest working code that has not been released yet. Any contributed code should
branch off of `develop`.

If you use Conda to manage your virtual environments, you can use `environment.yml` to create a Conda
virtual environment named `hillmaker` that will install dependencies for doing hillmaker development.

    conda env create -f environment.yml

If you don't use Conda, you can use `pip` along with `requirements.txt` to set up your development environment.

    pip install -r requirements.txt
    
After the dependencies are installed, you can do an editable install of hillamker into your virtual environment from the project root (where `setup.py` lives).

    pip install -e .
