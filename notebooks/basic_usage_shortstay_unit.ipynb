    "In this notebook we'll focus on basic use of hillmaker for analyzing arrivals, departures, and occupancy by time of day and day of week for a typical *discrete entity flow system*. A few examples of such systems include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- patients arriving, undergoing some sort of care process and departing some healthcare system (e.g. emergency department, surgical recovery, nursing unit, outpatient clinic, and many more)\n",
    "- customers renting, using, and returning bikes in a bike share system,\n",
    "- users of licensed software checking out, using, checking back in a software license,\n",
    "- products undergoing some sort of manufacturing or assembly process - occupancy is WIP,\n",
    "- patrons arriving, dining and leaving a restaurant,\n",
    "- travelers renting, residing in, and checking out of a hotel,\n",
    "- flights taking off and arriving at their destination,\n",
    "- ...\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically, any sort of discrete [stock and flow system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_and_flow) for which you are interested in time of day and day of week specific statistical summaries of occupancy, arrivals and departures, and have raw data on the arrival and departure times, is fair game for hillmaker."

Let's assume patients can be classified into one of five categories of patient types: ART (arterialgram), CAT (post cardiac-cath), MYE (myelogram), IVT (IV therapy), and OTH (other). From one of our hospital information systems we were able to get raw data about the entry and exit times of each patient and exported the data to a csv file. Let's take a peek at the data."

This version is much faster than previous versions (thank you numpy) and includes a CLI, flow conservation checks and better logging. It does however revert back to only allowing a single category field (multiple category fields can easily be handled by constructing composite category strings). You can read more about this latest release of Hillmaker at [https://misken.github.io/blog/hillmaker-python-released/](https://misken.github.io/blog/hillmaker-python-released/). It's free and open source.\n",

    "Hillmaker is implemented as an importable Python module and as a runnable script with a simple CLI. It can be used by importing `hillmaker` and then calling the main Hillmaker function, `make_hills()` (or any component function included in the module).  This new version of Hillmaker is still in what I'd call a pre-release state. The output does match the Access version for the ShortStay database that I included in the original Hillmaker. I've been actively using it to process thousands of simulation output log files as part of a research project on OB patient flow. More testing is needed before I release it publicly as version 1.0, but it does appear to be doing its primary job correctly. Please open an issue on GitHub if you think it's computing something incorrectly. Before using for any real project work, you should do your own testing to confirm that it is working appropriately for your needs. Use at your own risk - see [LICENSE file in GitHub](https://github.com/misken/hillmaker/blob/master/LICENSE)."

    "### Example 3 - Running via a Python script\n",
    "Of course, you don't have to run Python statements through an IPython notebook. You can simply create a short Python script and run that directly in a terminal. An example, `test_shortstay.py`, can be found in the `scripts` subfolder of the hillmaker-examples project. Here's what it looks like - you can modify as necessary for your needs. There is another example in that folder as well, `test_obsim_log.py`, that is slightly more complex in that the input data has raw simulation times (i.e. minutes past t=0) and we need to do some datetime math to turn them into calendar based inputs."
