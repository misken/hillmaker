## [0.8.1] - 2024-01-18

### Added

- published hillmaker paper in [JOSS](https://joss.theoj.org/)

### Changed

- added more detail to [occupancy computations documentation](https://hillmaker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/computing_occupancy.html)

## [0.8.0] - 2023-11-14

### Added

- object oriented API ([#37][d37])
- many input parameters for controlling hillmaker computations and outputs ([#50][i50] [#51][i51], [#54][i54])
- can specify inputs via TOML formatted config file if desired ([#33][i33])
- length of stay summary report ([#26][i26])
- input validation handled via a [pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/) model, ([#34][i34])
- documentation at https://hillmaker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html ([#9][i9])
- unit tests for occupancy computations ([#14][i14])
- added extensive conservation of flow checks ([#25][i25])
- detailed logging ([#21][i21])

### Changed

- CLI input arguments for controlling hillmaker computations and outputs ([#55][i55])
- function based API input arguments for controlling hillmaker computations and outputs ([#55][i55])
- enhanced plotting capabilities ([#36][i36])
- added examples to docstrings for API related elements ([#56][i56])
- removed option to treat missing departure timestamps as censored data.

### Fixed

- edge_bins = 2 (entire bin) was being treated as edge_bins = 1 (fractional arrival and departure bins) ([#43][i43])

## [0.4.6] - 2023-07-25

### Fixed

- if no category field is specified, the plots were not being generated. ([#42][i42])

## [0.4.5] - 2022-11-20

### Changed

- moved examples folder to project root
- updated dependencies to python>=3.9, pandas>=1.4, numpy>=1.22
- updated paths in ad-hoc tests to reflect new folder layout


## [0.4.4] - 2022-07-22

### Added

- weekly and dow plots of arrivals, departures, occupancy

## [0.4.3] - 2022-07-19

### Added

- can use TOML formatted config file for command line args
- added percentiles to CLI

### Changed

- renamed verbose argument to verbosity

## [0.4.2] - 2022-07-15

### Added

- Added option to treat missing departure timestamps as censored data.

### Fixed

- disallowed missing entry timestamps

## [0.4.1] - 2022-07-14

### Fixed

- date range sanity check had copy paste error with start and end variables
- removed old licensing references
- fixed typos in basic usage notebook
- added hillmaker related blog post links to readme

## [0.4.0] - 2022-07-14

### Added

- basic usage explainer notebook

### Fixed

- adjusted arrivals and departures by bin arrays to account for stops with arrivals or departures outside the analysis range

## [0.3.0] - 2022-05-13

### Added

- CLI
- flow conservation checks
- logging

### Changed

- Greatly improved speed by moving many computations into numpy arrays and vectorization.

### Deprecated

- deprecated use of multiple category fields and reverted to previous functionallity of a single (optional)
category field. Multiple categories are best handled with composite keys.

## [0.2.3] - 2020-03-18

### Fixed

- replaced call to deprecated time.clock() with time.process_time()

## [0.2.0] - 2020-02-04

### Added

- Added `edge_bins` parameter to control how occupancy contribution is computed
for arrival and departure bins. 1=fractional contribution (default), 2=whole bin
- Multiple category fields allowed. ([#17][i17])

- Can specify a field to use as occupancy weights. This can be useful
for building plots of workload instead of occupancy.

### Fixed

- Replace deprecated sortlevel() by sort_index() ([#20][i20])

## [0.1.1] - 2016-01-24

### Fixed

- Removed duplicate output of category, bin of day and day of week fields ([#18][i18])

## [0.1.0] - 2016-01-22

### Added

This is the first Python based release for hillmaker.

 * Takes a pandas DataFrame as the input data type
 * Functions for computing arrival, departure and occupancy summary statistics
   by time bin of day and day of week based on a pandas DataFrame containing one
   record per visit.
 * Functions for computing arrival, departure and occupancy for each datetime
   bin in the analysis period.
 * Select any time bin size (minutes) that divides evenly into a day.
 * Optionally specify one or more categories to ignore in the analysis.
 * Output statistics includes sample size, mean, min, max, standard deviation,
   coefficient of variation, standard error, skew, kurtosis, and a whole slew
   of percentiles (50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 97.5, 99).
 * Output CSV files are written by default but can be supressed.
 * Optionally capture outputs as a dictionary of pandas DataFrames for further
   post-processing (e.g. plot creation).
